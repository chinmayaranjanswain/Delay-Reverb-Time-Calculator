## ⚡ The Problem
In music production, setting your delay times and reverb decays manually can be a buzzkill. If your timings aren't mathematically synced to the BPM, your mix sounds "muddy." 

**Studio Time Calc** fixes this by giving you sample-accurate millisecond values instantly.



---

## ✨ Key Features
* **Instant Sync:** Type your BPM and hit `Enter` — no extra clicks needed.
* **One-Tap Copy:** Click "COPY" and the button turns green to confirm. Values are saved to your clipboard for instant pasting into your DAW.
* **Pro Layout:** Dark Mode interface designed to look like a hardware rack unit.
* **Precision Math:** Calculates down to 2 decimal places for 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and Reverb Bar lengths.

## 🛠️ Technical Breakdown
Built as part of my **BCA curriculum**, this project focuses on:
1.  **Event Binding:** Handling keyboard interrupts (`<Return>`).
2.  **Threaded UI:** Smooth transitions using the `after()` method for button feedback.
3.  **Encapsulation:** Clean, Object-Oriented Python code.
